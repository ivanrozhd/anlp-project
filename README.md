# anlp-deep-learning-project
This is the repository of the course project of Advanced Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning (Autumn 2024) at IT University of Copenhagen.

# Group Name and Members
Group 8 bilibili: Ivan Rozhdestvenskii and Levente Andr√°s Wallis 

Following is the structure of the project and steps to run the code:

Repository Structure
1. bnn/
Contains the code for the Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) implementation.
Includes a data/ folder with evaluation results used for Expected Calibration Error (ECE) calculation.
2. saplma/
Contains the code for the SAPLMA model implementation.
Includes a data/ folder with evaluation results used for Expected Calibration Error (ECE) calculation.
3. data/
Contains all the relevant data files required for model training and evaluation.
4. dataset_scripts/
Contains the scripts for dataset creation based on the provided dataset file (natural_questions_sample.csv).
5. ece/
Contains the code for Expected Calibration Error (ECE) calculation.


Datasets
1. chatgpt4_evaluation.csv
Contains:
Questions
Short answers (ground truth)
Responses from the pretrained model
Purpose: Evaluation of model responses.
2. dataset_hidden_layers.csv
Contains:
Questions
Short answers (ground truth)
Hidden layer representations (specifically layers 1, 16, and 32)
Purpose: Used for training purposes.
3. dataset_logits.csv
Contains:
Questions
Short answers (ground truth)
Model responses
Logits of the answers
Purpose: Used for detailed evaluation and analysis of model confidence.

Example command:
```shell
python dataset_creation.py  --token gt_dasdasdasdasdsafrgwr --model meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct --filepath data/natural_questions_sample.csv
```

evaluated.csv - a csv file with labels for the responses from chatgpt4 (1 - correct, 0 - incorrect)

# Train a SAPLMA/BayseianSAPLMA model for classification of the questions whether the model is able to answer them
Example command:
-hidden_state_path - csv file with hidden states
-labels_file - csv file with labels evaluated by chatgpt4
-arc - architecture of the model (saplma or bnn)
-layer - layer of the model (1, 16, 32)
```shell
python classifier_train.py  --hidden_states_path dataset_hidden_layers.csv --labels_file evaluated.csv --arc saplma/bnn --layer 1/16/32

```

# Help method to concatenate logits with labels

```shell
python logits_label.py  --label_data evaluated.csv  --logits_data dataset_logits.csv 

```

# Calculate ECE for the model

returns the estimated calibration error for the model

Example command:
```shell
python ece-evaluation.py  --file_data bnn_ece_1.csv 

```
