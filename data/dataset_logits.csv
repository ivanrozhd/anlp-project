19179,Answer the question concisely with only the answer: who sank the battleship uss maine in 1898 and why? Answer:,"The cause of Maine's sinking remains a subject of speculation. In 1898, An investigation of the explosion was carried out by a naval board appointed under the McKinley Administration. The consensus of the board was that Maine was destroyed by an external explosion from a mine. However, The validity of this investigation has been challenged. George W. Melville, A chief engineer in the Navy, Proposed that a more likely cause for the sinking was from a magazine explosion within the vessel. The Navy's leading ordnance expert, Philip R. Alger, Took this theory further by suggesting that the magazines were ignited by a spontaneous fire in a coal bunker. The coal used in Maine was bituminous coal, Which is known for releasing firedamp, A gas that is prone to spontaneous explosions. There is stronger evidence that the explosion of Maine was caused by an internal coal fire which ignited the magazines. This was a likely cause of the explosion, Rather than the initial hypothesis of a mine. The ship lay at the bottom of the harbor until 1911. A cofferdam was then built around the wreck. The hull was patched up until the ship was afloat, Then towed to sea and sunk. The Maine now lies on the sea - bed, 600 feet (,100 m) below the surface.",The Spanish sank the battleship,0.8754076957702637
